This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Readme

In order to have a public space available for recruiters and clients to learn more about me, I decided to create a portfolio website using my recent experiences in web development to create a responsive, attractive website.

I used Next.js and the Create Next App build application provided by vercel to create the initial structure, and using my knowledge of React and with the Documentation for Next.js I was able to enable my vision for a responsive web portfolio.

## Learnings

In the future, I think I will stick with the Vite React build tool if I'm creating a solely front-end website. Because that was my main intention for this website, I didn't use many of the backend features of Next.js to the fullest, and when it came to write my blog backend, I ended up using Express.js anyway.
